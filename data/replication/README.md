Description of files

Desmarais et al. (2015) APSR Online Appendix.pdf: Online appendix to the published article.

dhb2015apsr-modellinks-nomiss.tab: Stata dataset for the multilevel logit models of diffusion ties.

dhb2015apsr-modellinks-QAPiters.R: R script file for the multilevel logit models of diffusion ties.

dhb2015apsr-networks.csv: Networks in .csv format. There are two networks, selected based on model fit of the tuning parameters (see the article text for details). One is based on 300 edges over 35 years of adoption and the other is 400 edges over 10 years.

gaming.replication.R: R script file for Indian gaming replication (Boehmke 2005).

gaming.tab: Stata dataset for Indian gaming replication (Boehmke 2005).

infer_networks.R: R script that runs Netinf on the policy adoption data, produces parameter tuning fit plots, and generates CSV files of adjacency matrices corresponding to the inferred networks for each year at the hyperparameter values we use in the APSR piece.
	
lottery.replication.R: R script file for lottery replication (Berry and Berry 1990).

lottery.tab: Stata dataset for lottery replication (Berry and Berry 1990).

mkdata-network02-statehood.tab: Stata dataset giving statehood dates for all 50 states.

>mkdata-network02.tab: Stata dataset giving policy adoption dates.

mkdata-pooled01.tab: Stata dataset for pooled model replication (Boehmke and Skinner 2012).

pooled.replication.R: R script file for pooled model replication (Boehmke and Skinner 2012).

punishment.replication.R: R script file for capital punishment replication (Boehmke 2005).
